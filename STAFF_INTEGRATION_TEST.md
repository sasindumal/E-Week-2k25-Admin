# Staff Integration Test Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for verifying that "Staff" batch has been successfully integrated throughout the E-Week 2025 admin system.

## Updated Components

### Backend Changes
1. **LeaderBoard Schema** (`E-Week-2k25-Server/models/LeaderBoard.js`)
   - ✅ Added `StaffRank: [String]`
   - ✅ Added `Staff: [Number]`
   - ✅ Added `StaffPoints: Number`
   - ✅ Added `StaffImprovement: Number`

2. **LeaderBoard Controller** (`E-Week-2k25-Server/controllers/LeaderBoardController.js`)
   - ✅ Updated `addEventResult` to handle `StaffRank` and `StaffScore`
   - ✅ Updated creation logic to include Staff fields
   - ✅ Updated update logic to push Staff data to arrays
   - ✅ Updated improvement calculation to include Staff
   - ✅ `updatePoints` function already supports dynamic team names including "Staff"

### Frontend Changes
1. **AdminLeaderBoard** (`E-Week-2k25-Admin/src/pages/AdminLeaderBoard.js`)
   - ✅ Updated teams array to include "Staff"
   - ✅ Added special member count logic for Staff (15-20 members vs 40-50 for batches)

2. **SetResult Component** (`E-Week-2k25-Admin/src/pages/SetResult.js`)
   - ✅ Updated `secondFormData` to include `StaffRank` and `StaffScore`
   - ✅ Updated `options` array to include "Staff"
   - ✅ Updated form initialization to handle Staff fields

3. **EditableEventForm** (`E-Week-2k25-Admin/src/pages/EditableEventForm.js`)
   - ✅ Already includes "Staff" option in winner dropdowns

4. **EventRegistrationModal** (`E-Week-2k25-Admin/src/components/EventRegistrationModal.js`)
   - ✅ Updated batches array to include "Staff"
   - ✅ Removed inconsistent "E20" batch
   - ✅ Updated mock stats to include Staff

## Current Batch Configuration
The system now supports **5 teams/batches**:
- **E21** (2021 batch)
- **E22** (2022 batch)
- **E23** (2023 batch)
- **E24** (2024 batch)
- **Staff** (Staff members)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Leaderboard Display Test
- Navigate to `/admin/leaderboard`
- Verify that Staff appears as a row in the leaderboard table
- Verify Staff has points, wins, and improvement metrics
- Test editing Staff points functionality

### 2. Event Result Setting Test
- Create a new event or select an existing live event
- Navigate to Set Result page
- Verify "Staff" appears in all position dropdowns (Winner, 1st Runner-up, etc.)
- Test setting Staff as winner and verify leaderboard updates

### 3. Event Creation Test
- Navigate to Event Form
- Create a new event
- In EditableEventForm (for finished events), verify Staff option in winner dropdowns

### 4. Event Registration Test
- Test event registration modal
- Verify "Staff" appears in batch selection dropdown
- Verify Staff registration stats are tracked

## API Endpoints Affected
- `POST /api/LeaderBoard/addEventResult` - Now accepts StaffRank and StaffScore
- `POST /api/LeaderBoard/updatePoints/Staff` - Can update Staff points
- `GET /api/LeaderBoard/getLeaderBoard` - Returns Staff data in response

## Database Impact
Existing leaderboard documents will need Staff fields added. The system uses `upsert: true` option which should handle this gracefully by creating Staff fields with default values.

## Rollback Information
If rollback is needed, use checkpoint: `cgen-f6800`

## Notes
- Staff member count is set to 15-20 (vs 40-50 for student batches) in AdminLeaderBoard
- All hardcoded batch arrays have been updated to include Staff
- System maintains backwards compatibility with existing data
